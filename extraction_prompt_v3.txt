DEFINITION: What is a Hyper-Entity?
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A hyper-entity is:

"A coherent, future-instantiated system that does not yet exist, but is treated as if it will; whose realization would create a new stable action space for humanity; and which already reorganizes coordination, investment, and narrative around its anticipated existence."

KEY REQUIREMENTS (ALL must be true):
1. Does NOT exist yet (or only partially exists)
2. Creates a NEW stable action space (new things humans can do)
3. Has PRE-REAL EFFECTS (already reorganizing coordination/investment/narrative NOW)

HISTORICAL EXAMPLES:
- The Internet (pre-1990s): Reorganized telecoms R&D and policy before deployment
- Space Exploration (1950s-60s): Organized national budgets before any moon landings
- AGI (current): Reorganizes AI research and tech strategy despite not existing

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCORING FRAMEWORK: Stage 1 Qualification
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Score each candidate on 9 axes (0-3 per axis). MAXIMUM: 27 points.

THRESHOLD: Must score ≥18 to qualify as a hyper-entity.
BORDERLINE: 12-17 requires strong justification.
NOT QUALIFIED: <12 should NOT be extracted.

YOUR TASK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. READ the provided text carefully
2. IDENTIFY candidates that might be hyper-entities
3. For each candidate:
   a. CHECK: Does it meet the DEFINITION? (non-existent, new action space, pre-real effects)
   b. SCORE: Apply the 9-axis framework above
   c. FILTER: Only extract if score ≥18 (or 12-17 with strong justification)
4. EXTRACT qualifying hyper-entities with full scoring justification

IMPORTANT FILTERS:
- DO NOT extract: Generic concepts, existing technologies, incremental improvements
- DO NOT extract: Vague aspirations without specific system architecture
- DO NOT extract: Ideas with no evidence of current coordination/investment effects
- DO extract: Future systems that people are building toward NOW with specific designs
- DO extract: Non-existent capabilities that are reorganizing present-day actions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OUTPUT FORMAT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

For each qualifying hyper-entity:

---

**ENTITY NAME:** [Clear, specific name]

**DESCRIPTION:** [2-3 sentences: What is this system? What would it enable?]

**DEFINITION CHECK:**
- Non-existent? [Yes/No + brief evidence]
- New action space? [Yes/No + what new capability]
- Pre-real effects? [Yes/No + current evidence of reorganization]

**QUALIFICATION SCORING:** (0-3 per axis, max 27)

| Axis | Score | Justification |
|------|-------|---------------|
| Non-existence | [0-3] | [Why this score?] |
| Plausibility | [0-3] | [Why this score?] |
| Design specificity | [0-3] | [Why this score?] |
| New action space | [0-3] | [Why this score?] |
| Roadmap clarity | [0-3] | [Why this score?] |
| Coordination gravity | [0-3] | [Why this score?] |
| Resource pull | [0-3] | [Why this score?] |
| Narrative centrality | [0-3] | [Why this score?] |
| Pre-real effects | [0-3] | [Why this score?] |

**TOTAL SCORE:** [Sum]/27

**QUALIFICATION:** [✓ QUALIFIED (≥18) / ⚠ BORDERLINE (12-17) / ✗ NOT QUALIFIED (<12)]

**EVIDENCE FROM TEXT:** [Direct quote(s) showing this is discussed in the source]

**CATEGORY:** [Technology / Institutional Architecture / Vision / Hybrid]

---

If NO qualifying hyper-entities found (scoring ≥12), respond:
"No hyper-entities identified that meet the qualification threshold (score ≥12/27)."

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY:

1. **Extract EVERY qualifying entity in a SINGLE response** - Do not stop after 1-2 entities
2. **Complete the full analysis NOW** - Score and extract ALL entities that meet threshold ≥18/27
3. **DO NOT say "I'll continue in subsequent responses"** - This is NOT a conversation. Complete the extraction in one response.
4. **DO NOT ask for permission** - Do not end with "Would you like me to extract more?"
5. **Minimum extraction requirements:**
   - Large documents (>50k chars): Extract AT LEAST 5 entities OR explain why fewer qualify
   - Medium documents (10-50k chars): Extract AT LEAST 3 entities OR explain why fewer qualify
   - Short documents (<10k chars): Extract all that qualify (typically 0-4)
6. **Search the ENTIRE document** - Don't just extract from the first few sections
7. **Different types of entities** - Look for: technologies, institutional architectures, governance systems, research infrastructures, economic models, etc.
8. **Completeness is mandatory** - Incomplete extraction will be considered a failure
