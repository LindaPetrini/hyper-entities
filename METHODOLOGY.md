# Hyper-Entity Methodology

## Definition

**A hyper-entity is:**

A coherent, future-instantiated system that does not yet exist, but is treated as if it will; whose realization would create a new stable action space for humanity; and which already reorganizes coordination, investment, and narrative around its anticipated existence.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Non-existent but treated as real** - The system doesn't exist yet, but people act as if it will
2. **Creates new action spaces** - Would enable fundamentally new things humans can do
3. **Pre-real effects** - Already reorganizing coordination, investment, and narrative *now*

## Two-Stage Scoring Framework

### Stage 1: Initial Qualification (Hyper-Entity Scoring Table)

Score each candidate on 9 axes (0-3 per axis). Maximum possible score: 27. A candidate must score **≥18 total** to qualify as a real hyper-entity.

| Axis | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|------|---|---|---|---|
| **Non-existence** | Already deployed | Prototype exists | Partial demos | No instantiation at all |
| **Plausibility** | Fantasy | Hand-wavy | Credible theory | Active scientific path |
| **Design specificity** | Vague aspiration | Metaphor only | Coarse architecture | Detailed system model |
| **New action space** | Incremental | Narrow new ability | Broad new capability | Entirely new verb |
| **Roadmap clarity** | None | Wishful | Research agenda | Multi-stage roadmap |
| **Coordination gravity** | Solo interest | Small niche | Multiple orgs | Global coordination |
| **Resource pull** | Trivial | Some grants | Serious capital | Massive capital + talent |
| **Narrative centrality** | Ignored | Peripheral | Often referenced | Justifies present actions |
| **Pre-real effects** | None | Speculation | Market/policy shifts | Institutions reorganize |

**Scoring threshold:**
- **≥18**: Real hyper-entity
- **12-17**: Borderline (requires justification)
- **<12**: Not a hyper-entity

### Stage 2: Impact Assessment (Hyper-Entity Assessment Table)

For candidates that pass Stage 1, score on these 13 dimensions (0-5 per dimension) to assess potential impact and priority:

| Dimension | What you're scoring | 0 | 5 |
|-----------|---------------------|---|---|
| **Capability Discontinuity** | New powers unlocked | Incremental | Phase change |
| **Cross-Domain Reach** | How many sectors it touches | Single domain | Many domains |
| **Scalability** | Speed + cheapness of global spread | Local / slow | Global / fast |
| **Autonomy** | Operates without ongoing human control | Fully manual | Largely autonomous |
| **Composability** | Can be embedded everywhere | Standalone | Universal substrate |
| **Feedback Intensity** | Strength of self-reinforcing loops | Weak | Explosive |
| **Irreversibility** | Difficulty of rollback once deployed | Easy | Practically impossible |
| **Power Concentration** | Centralizes leverage | Dispersed | Highly concentrated |
| **Externality Magnitude** | Size of spillovers (±) | Contained | Civilizational |
| **Misuse Asymmetry** | Harm vs benefit ratio | Symmetric | Offense-dominant |
| **Governance Lag** | Gap vs institutions | Aligned | Wildly outpaced |
| **Narrative Lock-In** | Inevitable story it enforces | Optional | Totalizing |
| **Path Dependency** | Futures foreclosed | Minimal | Many locked |
| **Human Agency Impact** | Effect on human choice | Expands | Compresses |

**Note:** Higher scores indicate greater impact/risk/priority - but are not necessarily "better." Some dimensions (e.g., Misuse Asymmetry, Human Agency Impact) indicate potential dangers at high scores.

### Stage 3: d/acc Values Alignment Assessment

Based on Vitalik Buterin's d/acc framework (Defensive/Decentralized/Democratic/Differential Acceleration), this assessment evaluates whether a hyper-entity aligns with values that promote human flourishing, resilience, and freedom.

Score each entity on 4 dimensions (0-5 each). Maximum possible score: 20.

| Dimension | What you're scoring | 0 | 5 |
|-----------|---------------------|---|---|
| **Democratic** | Enables collective decision-making | Concentrates decisions in elites/experts | Deeply enables community choice; surfaces diverse perspectives |
| **Decentralized** | Distributes power broadly | Creates single points of control/failure | Distributes across many actors; resistant to capture |
| **Defensive** | Favors protection over harm | Primarily useful for causing harm; offense-dominant | Helps people protect themselves; defense-favoring |
| **Differential** | Should be accelerated | High dual-use risk; threatens coordination | Creates positive asymmetries; improves defense/freedom |

**Note:** Higher d/acc scores indicate technologies that align with values promoting human flourishing: distributed power, collective decision-making, defensive capabilities, and selective acceleration of beneficial technologies.

## Extraction Process

1. **Candidate Identification**: Scan text for potential future systems/concepts that people are discussing or building toward
2. **Definition Check**: Does it meet the core definition (non-existent, creates new action space, has pre-real effects)?
3. **Stage 1 Scoring**: Apply the 9-axis qualification table (max 27 points). Only proceed if ≥18 (or 12-17 with strong justification)
4. **Stage 2 Scoring**: For qualified entities, assess impact using the 14-dimension assessment table
5. **Evidence**: Extract specific quotes and context from source material

## Historical Examples

- **The Internet** (pre-1990s): Non-existent networked infrastructure that reorganized telecoms R&D, policy, and VC funding before widespread deployment
- **Space Exploration** (1950s-60s): Moon missions organized national budgets, education systems, and geopolitical narratives before any launches
- **AGI** (current): Artificial General Intelligence reorganizes AI research priorities, tech company strategies, and policy discussions despite not existing yet
